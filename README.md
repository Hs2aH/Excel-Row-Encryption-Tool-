# Excel-Row-Encryption-Tool-
This Python script is a security tool designed to automate the encryption of individual rows from an Excel file. It uses OpenSSL with AES-256-CBC encryption to secure each row as a separate file, making it ideal for demonstrating row-level data protection. A log file is automatically generated to map each encrypted file to its unique password.
